## This is where your Laravel app goes

To get started, **delete this file** and then do one of the following:

- Clone your project or copy all of the files directly into this `src` directory.
- Install a brand new Laravel project by running `docker compose run --rm  --user $(1000 -u):$(1000 -g) composer create-project laravel/laravel .` in your terminal.
